# codsoft_4
This repository contains the code for Task 4 of my CodSoft Python Internship. The task involved creating a basic Rock Paper Scissors game using Python. The game allows users to play against the computer, with the computerâ€™s choices being randomly generated. To ensure better understanding and ease of use, I have included comments throughout the code. These comments explain the purpose of various sections and functions, making it easier for new users to follow along and understand the logic behind the code
